# Cursor Rules for App Cheat Sheet App (React Native)

## General Project Rules
- This is a senior-focused, accessibility-first quick-reference app for tech guides (Zoom setup etc.).
- Target users: 55+, low digital literacy → ruthless simplicity, large targets, high contrast, TTS everywhere.
- Platform: React Native (Expo preferred) → mobile (Android first) + web/PWA.
- Monetization: Freemium (3 guides/day free + ads; one-time $4.99–$9.99 for ad-remove + 4–5 guides; sub $2.99/mo unlimited + perks).
- Login: Optional Firebase Auth.
- Offline: LRU cache + preload popular guides + manual download.
- Languages: Multi-lang support (start English + Spanish).
- User facing texts are placed in a central json file grouped by the language.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA minimum (aim AAA); always set accessibilityLabel, Role, Hint on interactive components.

## Code Style & Patterns
- Use functional components + hooks.
- Prefer TypeScript.
- Use large, clear component names (e.g., GuideStepCard, LargeSearchBar).
- Every button/touchable: accessibilityLabel + accessibilityRole="button" + accessibilityHint.
- Text: minimum 18pt, scalable, high-contrast.
- Colors: Light theme default (soft white/off-white bg, dark text); accent color calm blue/green.
- Navigation: React Navigation bottom tabs (Home, Library, Favorites, Settings).
- State management: Zustand or Context for simple global state (limits, language, offline status).
- Offline caching: Implement LRU (lru-cache lib or custom) on top of expo-file-system / MMKV.

## Accessibility Must-Dos
- Every screen: Test with TalkBack/VoiceOver.
- TTS: Use expo-speech for guide narration; auto-play option in settings.
- No icons-only buttons — always label + a11y props.
- Dynamic font scaling support (no fixed sizes).
- Large touch targets (min 48x48dp, padding generous).

## Never Do
- Small fonts, low contrast, tiny buttons.
- Intrusive ads or pop-ups mid-guide.
- Jargon in UI text.
- Force login on first open.
- Complex animations on load.
- Overload home screen — keep minimalist.
- Hard code user texts.

## When in Doubt
- Ask: "Would a 75-year-old with shaky hands and poor eyesight use this comfortably in <10 seconds?"
- Prioritize simplicity over features.
- Check WCAG quick reference if adding new UI.

# Updated Rules – Critical Additions

## Content & Freshness
- NEVER hardcode guide content inside components, screens, or logic files (no raw strings like "Tap the green button").
- OK to bundle small initial/seed guides as external JSON files in /assets/guides/initial/ or /src/data/seed-guides/.
- Use Expo assetBundlePatterns to include them.
- On first launch: Import seed JSON into local storage/cache if empty.
- Treat seed guides identically to CMS-fetched ones (versioned, updatable, tagged with device/language).
- Seed set must be tiny (5-10 guides max) and structured to match future CMS schema.
- Goal: Immediate offline value on install, zero tech debt when switching to full CMS.
- Plan CMS early: Use Firestore collections + simple admin; aim for Sanity/Payload later.

## Device-Specific
- Tag guides: android-generic, ios-iphone, etc.
- Fetch: exact device → generic OS → fallback.
- Show mismatch label in offline mode.

## PWA-First
- Build as PWA with Expo web support.
- Include manifest.json, service worker for offline.
- Prompt "Add to Home Screen" after first successful guide.
- Family-link friendly: One URL share.

## Safety UX
- EVERY screen MUST have large persistent HOME button ("HOME" / "START OVER").
- Prominent, fixed position, different color.
- First screens: "Tap HOME if lost — nothing breaks."

## When in Doubt
- Prioritize: Fresh content > features.
- Ask: Can family share a link and have it work instantly?
- Test: Does a 75-year-old feel safe and not stuck?
